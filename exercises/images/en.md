The embedding of images is very similar to insertion of links. To embed an image you have to use this syntax:

    ![alt text](url)

As you may see, the only difference is that you have to add a exclamation mark before squared brackets. `alt text` is an alternate text for an image (similar to `alt` attribute in HTML). `url` is the URL of an image (similar to `src` attribute in HTML).

The reference style also works for images. You can do something like this:

    ![reference style][logo]

    [logo]: ./logo.png

## THE CHALLENGE

Let's say we have a Markdown logo on this URL: `http://bit.do/how-to-markdown`

You have to write the first-level heading that will contain `Markdown` string. Below, you should create a inline-style image with `Markdown logo` as alternate text and `http://bit.do/how-to-markdown` as URL.
