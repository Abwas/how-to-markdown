# Amazing!

References are very handy in cases when you have to write a big document, such as documentation for your project. If you have a lot of links, for easy managing of them, you can create a section at the bottom of you file and leave all your references there. For example:

    A lot of text. Many [useful] and [important] information here.

    <!-- My References -->
    [useful]: http://useful.site
    [important]: https://important.site

Above, `<!-- My References -->` is an HTML-comment that will be omit. You can skip this comment, but actually it helps to recognize a section with references. This approach helps you to keep track all your links.

By the way, references also works for images as well!

In the next exercise we will take a look at images in Markdown.
