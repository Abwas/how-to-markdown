Sometimes we need to quote someone's words. In that case, blockquotes are exactly what we need.

The syntax of blockquotes is simple:

    > This is a my blockquote.
    > This line is part of the same quote.

This will look like this:

> This is a my blockquote.
> This line is part of the same quote.

As you have seen, the line-break doesn't break a block of quote. To separate a few quotes just add an empty line between them.

You are able to put Markdown into a blockquote, therefore this will works as well:

    > **Markdown** is a _lightweight markup language_ with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to **HTML** and many other formats.
    > - from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

## THE CHALLENGE

Start the new file with `Blockquotes` as heading.

Add a quote of **William Shakespeare**'s play _Hamlet_:

> To be, or not to be, that is the question.

And add an original author to the quote right on the next line after this quote. If you have done, verify your solution.
