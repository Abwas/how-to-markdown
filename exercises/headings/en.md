It's important to categorize information. That's when headings come to help us.

If you need to add a heading just type a `#` sign. The amount of `#` is a level of heading. For example:

    # Heading 1
    ## Heading 2
    ### Heading 3
    #### Heading 4
    ##### Heading 5
    ###### Heading 6

As in HTML, there is 6 levels of headings. This headings will be transformed into `<h1>`-`<h6>` tags accordingly.

There are aliases for first- and second-level headings. You can type a three dashes (`-`) right on the next line for creating a second-level heading. If you type three equality sign, then you will get a first-level heading. Example:

    Heading 2
    ===

    Heading 2
    ---

## THE CHALLENGE

Please create a first-level heading with `Markdown is awesome!` and then verify your solution.
