Sometimes we have to divide some information. In HTML we use `<hr>` tag, which means _**h**orizontal **r**ule_.

There's nothing hard to make a horizontal rule in Markdown. Just type three or more dashes (`-`), asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`):

    Dashes

    ---

    Asterisks

    ***

    Underscores

    ___

And it will turns into:

Dashes

---

Asterisks

***

Underscores

___


As you may remember from _Headings_ exercises, three dashes on the next line makes a second-level headings. To avoid this behavior, just add an empty line between text and these dashes.

## THE CHALLENGE

Please add an `Horizontal rules` heading and add a horizontal rules right after this heading.

That's it. Just verify your solution.
