List are important for structured information. There is nothing hard in creating of lists in Markdown. Just insert before each item an asterisk (`*`) or dash (`-`) for unordered list and number with dot for ordered one.

### Unordered lists

For example, here is an example of unordered list:

    * item1
    * item2
    * item3

And it will be transformed in something like this:

* item1
* item2
* item3

Dashes work as well:

    - first item with dash
    - second item with dash

Goes to:

- first item with dash
- second item with dash

### Ordered lists

Here is an example of simple ordered list:

    1. item1
    2. item2
    3. item3

Which will be transformed into:

1. item1
2. item2
3. item3

As you may see, this notation is very intuitive and readable.

### Nested lists

There is nothing hart to make a nested list. Just add a tab, or spaces for nested elements such as:

    - element 1
      - element 1.2
      - element 1.3
    - element 2
      - element 2.1
    - element 3

For lists with `*` and ordered lists it works as well.

## THE CHALLENGE

Try to write your own list. Please create new file and create an unordered list in it:

- One
  - 1.1
  - 1.2
- Two
  - 2.1
  - 2.2
- Three
- Four
- Five

If you have done, please verify your solution.
